                <h1>Statements and the structure of a program</h1>
                <p>
                    A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the
                    computer what to do. A <span class="bold">statement</span> is a type
                    of instruction that causes the program to
                    <span class="italic">perform some action</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Statements are by far the most common type of instruction in a C++ program. This is because they are
                    the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like
                    sentences do in natural language. When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically
                    write or speak in sentences (not in random words or syllables). In C++, when we want to have our
                    program do something we typically write statements.
                </p>
                <p>Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon,
                    it’s probably a statement.</p>
                <p>In a high-level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine language
                    instructions.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h1>Functions and the <span class="code-text">main</span> function</h1>
                <p>In C++, statements are typically grouped into units called functions. A <span
                        class="bold">function</span> is a collection of
                    statements that get executed sequentially (in order, from top to bottom). As you learn to write your
                    own programs, you’ll be able to create your own functions and mix and match statements in any way
                    you please (we’ll show how in a future lesson).</p>
                <p>When the program is run, the statements inside of <span class="code-text">main</span> are executed in
                    sequential order.</p>
                <p>Programs typically terminate (finish running) after the last statement inside function <span
                        class="code-text">main</span> has been
                    executed (though programs may abort early in some circumstances, or do some cleanup afterwards).
                </p>
                <p>Functions are typically written to do a specific job or perform some useful action. For example, a
                    function named <span class="code-text">max</span> might contain statements that figures out which of
                    two numbers is larger. A
                    function named <span class="code-text">calculateGrade</span> might calculate a student’s grade from
                    a set of test scores. A
                    function named <span class="code-text">printEmployee</span> might print an employee’s information to
                    the console. We will talk a
                    lot more about functions soon, as they are the most commonly used organizing tool in a program.</p>
                <p>In programming, the name of a function (or object, type, template, etc…) is called its <span
                        class="bold">identifier</span>.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h1>Characters and text</h1>
                <p>In written language, the most basic unit of communication is the character. To simplify slightly, a
                    <span class="bold">character</span> is a written symbol or mark, such as a letter, digit,
                    punctuation mark, or mathematical
                    symbol. When we tap an alphabetic or numeric key on our keyboard, a character is produced as a
                    result, which can then be displayed on the screen. The following are all characters: <span
                        class="code-text">a</span>, <span class="code-text">2</span>, <span class="code-text">$</span>,
                    and <span class="code-text">=</span>.
                </p>
                <p>In many cases, such as when writing words or sentences, we want to make use of more than one
                    character. A sequence of characters is called <span class="bold">text</span> (also called a <span
                        class="bold">string</span> in programming contexts).
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h1>Hello world!</h1>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | #include &lt;iostream&gt;
2 | 
3 | int main() 
4 | &lbrace; 
5 |   std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world!"; 
6 |   return 0; 
7 | &rbrace;</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>Line 1 is a special type of line called a preprocessor directive. This <span
                        class="code-text">#include</span> preprocessor
                    directive indicates that we would like to use the contents of the <span
                        class="code-text">iostream</span> library, which is the
                    part of the C++ standard library that allows us to read and write text from/to the console. We need
                    this line in order to use <span class="code-text">std::cout</span> on line 5. Excluding this line
                    would result in a compile error
                    on line 5, as the compiler wouldn’t otherwise know what <span class="code-text">std::cout</span> is.
                </p>
                <p>Line 2 is blank, and is ignored by the compiler. This line exists only to help make the program more
                    readable to humans (by separating the <span class="code-text">#include</span> preprocessor directive
                    and the subsequent parts of
                    the program).
                </p>
                <p>Line 3 tells the compiler that we’re going to write (define) a function whose name (identifier) is
                    <span class="code-text">main</span>. As you learned above, every C++ program must have a <span
                        class="code-text">main</span> function or it will fail to link.
                    This function will produce a value whose type is <span class="code-text">int</span> (an integer).
                </p>
                <p>Lines 4 and 7 tell the compiler which lines are part of the <span class="italic">main</span>
                    function. Everything between the
                    opening curly brace on line 4 and the closing curly brace on line 7 is considered part of the <span
                        class="code-text">main</span>
                    function. This is called the function body.</p>
                <p>
                    Line 5 is the first statement within function <span class="code-text">main</span>, and is the first
                    statement that will execute
                    when we run our program. <span class="code-text">std::cout</span> (which stands for “character
                    output”) and the <span class="code-text">&lt;&lt;</span> operator
                    allow
                    us to display information on the console. In this case, we’re displaying the text <span
                        class="code-text">Hello world!</span>.
                    This statement creates the visible output of the program. </p>
                <p>Line 6 is a return statement. When an executable program finishes running, the program sends a value
                    back to the operating system in order to indicate whether it ran successfully or not. This
                    particular return statement returns the integer value <span class="code-text">0</span> to the
                    operating system, which means
                    “everything went okay!”. This is the last statement in the program that executes.</p>
                <p>All of the programs we write will follow this general template, or a variation on it.</p>

                <h1>Syntax and syntax errors</h1>
                <p>The set of rules that describe how specific words (and punctuation) can be arranged to form valid
                    sentences in a language is called <span class="bold">syntax</span>.</p>
                <p>The C++ programming language also has a syntax, which describes how the elements of your program must
                    be written and arranged in order for the program to be considered valid. When you compile your
                    program, the compiler is responsible for making sure your program follows these syntactical rules.
                    If your program does something that deviates from the syntax of the language, the compiler will halt
                    compilation and issue a _syntax error.</p>
                <p>Unlike the English language, which allows for a lot of ambiguity, the syntax rules of C++ are
                    strictly defined and upheld. Syntax errors are common. Fortunately, such errors are typically
                    straightforward to find and fix, as the compiler will generally point you right at them. Compilation
                    of a program will only complete once all syntax errors are resolved.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
            <header class="main-section-header">Comments</header>
            <article>
                <p>A <span class="bold">comment</span> is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the
                    source code of the
                    program. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are for the programmer’s use only.</p>
                <p>In C++ there are two different styles of comments, both of which serve the same purpose: to help
                    programmers document the code in some way.</p>
                <h1>Single-line comments</h1>
                <p>The <span class="code-text">//</span> symbol begins a C++ single-line comment, which tells the
                    compiler to ignore everything from
                    the <span class="code-text">//</span> symbol to the end of the line. For example:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world!"; // Everything from here to here to the end of the line is ignored</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>Typically, the single-line comment is used to make a quick comment about a single line of code.</p>
                <h1>Multi-line comments</h1>
                <p>The <span class="code-text">/*</span> and <span class="code-text">*/</span> pair of symbols denotes a
                    C-style multi-line comment. Everything in between the symbols
                    is ignored.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | /* This is a multi-line comment.
2 |    This line will be ignored.
3 |    So will this one. */</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <h1>Proper use of comments</h1>
                <p>Typically, comments should be used for three things. First, for a given library, program, or
                    function, comments are best used to describe <span class="italic">what</span> the library, program,
                    or function, does. These are
                    typically placed at the top of the file or library, or immediately preceding the function.
                </p>
                <p>Second, <span class="italic">within</span> a library, program, or function described above, comments
                    can be used to describe <span class="italic">how</span> the code is going to accomplish its goal.
                </p>
                <p>Third, at the statement level, comments should be used to describe <span class="italic">why</span>
                    the code is doing something. A
                    bad statement comment explains <span class="italic">what</span> the code is doing. If you ever write
                    code that is so complex
                    that needs a comment to explain <span class="italic">what</span> a statement is doing, you probably
                    need to rewrite your
                    statement, not comment it.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, comments should be written in a way that makes sense to someone who has no idea what the
                    code does. It is often the case that a programmer will say “It’s obvious what this does! There’s no
                    way I’ll forget about this”. Guess what? It’s <span class="italic">not</span> obvious, and you <span
                        class="italic">will</span> be amazed how quickly you
                    forget. :&rpar; You (or someone else) will thank you later for writing down the what, how, and why
                    of your code in human language. Reading individual lines of code is easy. Understanding what goal
                    they are meant to accomplish is not.</p>
                <h1>Commenting out code</h1>
                <p>Converting one or more lines of code into a comment is called <span class="bold">commenting
                        out</span> your code. This provides
                    a convenient way to (temporarily) exclude parts of your code from being included in your compiled
                    program.
                </p>
                <p>To comment out a single line of code, simply use the <span class="code-text">//</span> style comment
                    to turn a line of code into a
                    comment temporarily:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | //  std::cout &lt;&lt; 1;</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>To comment out a block of code, use <span class="code-text">//</span> on multiple lines of code, or
                    the <span class="code-text">/* */</span> style comment to turn
                    the block of code into a comment temporarily.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | //  std::cout &lt;&lt; 1;
2 | //  std::cout &lt;&lt; 2;
3 | //  std::cout &lt;&lt; 3;</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | /*                        
2 |     std::cout &lt;&lt; 1;
3 |     std::cout &lt;&lt; 2;
4 |     std::cout &lt;&lt; 3;
5 | */</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>There are quite a few reasons you might want to do this:</p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You’re working on a new piece of code that won’t compile yet, and you need to run the program.
                        The compiler won’t let you compile the code if there are compiler errors. Commenting out the
                        code that won’t compile will allow the program to compile so you can run it. When you’re ready,
                        you can uncomment the code, and continue working on it.</li>
                    <li>You’ve written new code that compiles but doesn’t work correctly, and you don’t have time to fix
                        it until later. Commenting out the broken code will ensure the broken code doesn’t execute and
                        cause problems until you can fix it.</li>
                    <li>To find the source of an error. If a program isn’t producing the desired results (or is
                        crashing), it can sometimes be useful to disable parts of your code to see if you can isolate
                        what’s causing it to not work correctly. If you comment out one or more lines of code, and your
                        program starts working as expected (or stops crashing), odds are whatever you last commented out
                        was part of the problem. You can then investigate why those lines of code are causing the
                        problem.</li>
                    <li>You want to replace one piece of code with another piece of code. Instead of just deleting the
                        original code, you can comment it out and leave it there for reference until you’re sure your
                        new code works properly. Once you are sure your new code is working, you can remove the old
                        commented out code. If you can’t get your new code to work, you can always delete the new code
                        and uncomment the old code to revert to what you had before.</li>

                <h1>Data and values</h1>
                <p>A program can acquire data to work with in many ways: from a file or database, over a network, from
                    the user providing input on a keyboard, or from the programmer putting data directly into the source
                    code of the program itself.</p>
                <p>In programming, a single piece of data is called a <span class="bold">value</span> (sometimes called
                    a <span class="bold">data value</span>). Common
                    examples of values include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers (e.g. <span class="code-text">5</span> or <span class="code-text">-6.7</span>).</li>
                    <li>Characters, which are placed between single-quotes (e.g. <span class="code-text">'H'</span> or
                        <span class="code-text">'$'</span>). Only a single symbol may
                        be used.
                    </li>
                    <li>Text, which must be placed between double-quotes (e.g. <span class="code-text">"Hello"</span> or
                        <span class="code-text">"H"</span>). Text can contain 0 or
                        more characters.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Values that are placed directly into the source code are called <span class="bold">literals</span>.
                </p>
                <h1>Random Access Memory</h1>
                <p>The main memory in a computer is called <span class="bold">Random Access Memory</span> (often called
                    <span class="bold">RAM</span> for short). When we
                    run a program, the operating system loads the program into RAM. Any data that is hardcoded into the
                    program itself (e.g. text such as “Hello, world!”) is loaded at this point.
                </p>
                <p>You can think of RAM as a series of numbered boxes that can be used to store data while the program
                    is running.</p>
                <h1>Objects and variables</h1>
                <p>In C++, direct memory access is discouraged. Instead, we access memory indirectly through an <span
                        class="bold">object</span>.
                    An object represents a region of storage (typically RAM or a CPU register) that can hold a value.
                </p>
                <h1>Variable definition</h1>
                <p>In order to use a variable in our program, we need to tell the compiler that we want one. The most
                    common way to do this is by use of a special kind of declaration statement called a <span
                        class="bold">definition</span>.</p>
                <p>Here’s an example of defining a variable named <span class="code-text">x</span>:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | int x; // define a variable named x (of type int)</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>At <span class="bold">compile-time</span> (when the program is being compiled), when encountering
                    this statement, the compiler
                    makes a note to itself that we want a variable with the name <span class="code-text">x</span>, and
                    that the variable has the data
                    type <span class="code-text">int</span> (more on data types in a moment). From that point forward,
                    whenever we use the identifier <span class="code-text">x</span>
                    in our code, the compiler will know
                    that we are referring to this variable.</p>
                <p>A variable created via a definition statement is said to be <span class="bold">defined</span> at the
                    point where the definition
                    statement is placed. For now, your variables should be defined inside functions (such as within
                    <span class="code-text">main()</span>).
                </p>
                <h1>Variable creation</h1>
                <p>At <span class="bold">runtime</span> (when the program is loaded into memory and run), each object is
                    given an actual storage
                    location (such as RAM, or a CPU register) that it can use to store values. The process of reserving
                    storage for an object’s use is called <span class="bold">allocation</span>. Once allocation has
                    occurred, the object has been
                    created and can be used.</p>
                <h1>Data types</h1>
                <p>So far, we’ve covered that objects are regions of storage that can store a data value (how exactly
                    data is stored is a topic for a future lesson). A <span class="bold">data type</span> (more commonly
                    just called a <span class="bold">type</span>)
                    determines what kind of value (e.g. a number, a letter, text, etc…) the object will store.</p>
                <p>In C++, the type of an object must be known at compile-time, and that type can not be changed without
                    recompiling the program. This means an integer variable can only hold integer values. If you want to
                    store some other kind of value, you’ll need to use a different type.</p>
                <p>These are the basic data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>boolean - stores true or false values</li>
                    <li>char - stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values</li>
                    <li>int - stores whole numbers, without decimals</li>
                    <li>float - stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7
                        decimal</li>
                    <li>double - stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15
                        decimal digits</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Defining multiple variables</h1>
                <p>It is possible to define multiple variables <span class="italic">of the same type</span> in a single
                    statement by separating the
                    names with a comma. The following code snippet:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | int a;
2 | int b;</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        <pre>
1 | int a, b;</pre>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>When defining multiple variables this way, there are two common mistakes that new programmers tend
                    to make (neither serious, since the compiler will catch these and ask you to fix them):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first mistake is giving each variable a type when defining variables in sequence, and</li>
                    <li>The second mistake is to try to define variables of different types in the same statement, which
                        is not allowed. Variables of different types must be defined in separate statements.</li>
                </ol>

            </header>
            <article>
                <h1>Variable assignment</h1>
                <p>After a variable has been defined, you can give it a value (in a separate statement) using the <span
                        class="code-text">=</span> operator. This process is called <span
                        class="bold">assignment</span>, and the <span class="code-text">=</span> operator is called the
                    <span class="bold">assignment operator</span>
                </p>
                <p>By default, assignment copies the value on the right-hand side of the <span class="italic">=
                        operator</span> to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. This is called <span
                        class="bold">copy-assignment</span>.</p>
                <p>Assignment can be used whenever we want to change the value held by a variable.</p>
                <h1>Variable initialization</h1>
                <p>When an object is defined, you can optionally provide an initial value for the object. The process of
                    specifiying an initial value for an object is called <span class="bold">initialization</span>, and
                    the syntax used to initialize an object is called an <span class="bold">initializer</span>.
                    Informally, the initial value is often called an "initializer" as well.</p>
                <h1>Different forms of initialization</h1>
                <p>Unlike assignment (which is generally straightforward), initialization in C++ is surprisingly
                    complex.</p>
                <p>There are 5 common froms of initialization in C++:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <pre>
1 | int a;         // default-initialization (no initializer)
2 |
3 | // Traditional initialization forms:
4 | int b = 5;     // copy-initialization (initial value after equals sign)
5 | int c ( 6 );   // direct-initialization (initial value in parentheses)
6 |
7 | // Modern initalization forms (preferred):
8 | int d { 7 };   // direct list-initialization (initial value in braces)
9 | int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces)</pre>
                </div>
                <p>You may see the above forms written with different spacing (e.g. <span class="code-text">int
                        b=5;</span> <span class="code-text">int c(6);</span>, <span class="code-text">int d{7};</span>,
                    <span class="code-text">int e{};</span>). Whether you use extra spaces for readability or not is a
                    matter of personal preference.
                </p>
                <h1>Default-initialization</h1>
                <p>When no initializer is provided (such as for variable <span class="code-text">a</span> above), this
                    is called <span class="bold">default-initialization</span>. In many cases, default-initialization
                    performs no initialization, and leaves the variable with an indeterminate value (a value that is not
                    predictable, sometimes called a "garbage value").</p>
                <h1>Copy-initialization</h1>
                <p>When an initial value is provided after an equals sign, this is called <span
                        class="bold">copy-initialization</span>. This form of initialization was inherited from the C
                    language.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <pre>
1 | int width = 5;</pre>
                </div>
                <p>Copy-initialization had fallen out of favor in modern C++ due to being less efficient than other
                    forms of initialization for some complex types. However, C++17 remedied the bulk of these issues,
                    and copy-initialization is now finding new advocates.</p>
                <h1>Direct-initialization</h1>
                <p>When an initial value is provided inside parenthesis, this is called <span
                        class="bold">direct-initialization</span>.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <pre>
1 | int width ( 5 );</pre>
                </div>
                <p>Direct-initialization was initially introduced to allow for more efficient initialization of complex
                    objects (those with class types, which we’ll cover in a future chapter). Just like
                    copy-initialization, direct-initialization had fallen out of favor in modern C++, largely due to
                    being superseded by direct-list-initialization.</p>
                <h1>List-initialization</h1>
                <p>The modern way to initialize objects in C++ is to use a form of initialization that makes use of
                    curly braces. This is called <span class="bold">list-initialization</span> (or <span
                        class="bold">uniform initialization</span> or <span class="bold">brace initialization</span>).
                </p>
                <p>List-initialization comes in two forms:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <pre>
1 | int width { 5 };    // preferred
2 | int height = { 6 }; // rarely used</pre>
                </div>
                <p>List-initialization was introduced to provide a initialization syntax that works in almost all cases,
                    behaves consistently, and has an unambiguous syntax that makes it easy to tell where we’re
                    initializing an object.</p>
                <p>Additionally, list-initialization also provides a way to initialize objects with a list of values
                    rather than a single value (which is why it is called “list-initialization”).</p>
                <h1>Zero-initialization</h1>
                <p>In most cases, value-initialization will implicitly initialize the variable to zero (or whatever
                    value is closest to zero for a given type). In cases where zeroing occurs, this is called
                    <span class="bold">zero-initialization</span>.
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <pre>
1 | int width {};</pre>
                </div>
                <h1>Instantiation</h1>
                <p>The term <span class="bold">instantiation</span> is a fancy word that means a variable has been
                    created (allocated) and
                    initialized (this includes default initialization). An instantiated object is sometimes called an
                    <span class="bold">instance</span>. Most often, this term is applied to class type objects, but it
                    is occasionally applied to
                    objects of other types as well.
                </p>
                <h1>Unused initialized variables warnings</h1>
                <p>Modern compilers will typically generate warnings if a variable is initialized but not used (since
                    this is rarely desirable). And if “treat warnings as errors” is enabled, these warnings will be
                    promoted to errors and cause the compilation to fail.</p>
                <p>There are a few easy ways to fix this.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the variable really is unused and you don’t need it, then the easiest option is to remove the
                        definition of <span class="code-text">x</span> (or comment it out). After all, if it’s not used,
                        then removing it won’t affect anything.</li>
                    <li>Another option is to simply use the variable somewhere.</li>
                </ol>

                <h1>Uninitialized variables</h1>
                <p>Unlike some programming languages, C/C++ does not automatically initialize most variables to a given
                    value (such as zero). When a variable that is not initialized is given a memory address to use to
                    store data, the default value of that variable is whatever (garbage) value happens to already be in
                    that memory address! A variable that has not been given a known value (through initialization or
                    assignment) is called an <span class="bold">uninitialized variable.</span></p>
                <p>To recap:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initialized = The object is given a known value at the point of definition.</li>
                    <li>Assignment = The object is given a known value beyond the point of definition.</li>
                    <li>Uninitialized = The object has not been given a known value yet.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Undefined behavior</h1>
                <p><span class="bold">Undefined behavior</span> (often abbreviated <span class="bold">UB</span>) is the
                    result of executing code whose behavior is not
                    well-defined by the C++ language. In this case, the C++ language doesn’t have any rules determining
                    what happens if you use the value of a variable that has not been given a known value. Consequently,
                    if you actually do this, undefined behavior will result.</p>
                <p>Code implementing undefined behavior may exhibit any of the following symptoms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your program produces different results every time it is run.</li>
                    <li>Your program consistently produces the same incorrect result.</li>
                    <li>Your program behaves inconsistently (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).</li>
                    <li>Your program seems like it’s working but produces incorrect results later in the program.</li>
                    <li>Your program crashes, either immediately or later.</li>
                    <li>Your program works on some compilers but not others.</li>
                    <li>Your program works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Or, your code may actually produce the correct behavior anyway.</p>
                <h1>Implementation-defined behavior and unspecified behavior</h1>
                <p>A specific compiler and the associated standard library it comes with are called an <span
                        class="bold">implementation</span>
                    (as these are what actually implements the C++ language). In some cases, the C++ language standard
                    allows the implementation to determine how some aspect of the language will behave, so that the
                    compiler can choose a behavior that is efficient for a given platform. Behavior that is defined by
                    the implementation is called <span class="bold">implementation-defined behavior</span>.
                    Implementation-defined behavior must
                    be documented and consistent for a given implementation.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Unspecified behavior</span> is almost identical to implementation-defined behavior
                    in that the behavior is
                    left up to the implementation to define, but the implementation is not required to document the
                    behavior.</p>

                <h1>The input/output library</h1>
                <p>The <span class="bold">input/output library</span> (io library) is part of the C++ standard library
                    that deals with basic input
                    and output. We’ll use the functionality in this library to get input from the keyboard and output
                    data to the console. The <span class="italic">io</span> part of <span class="italic">iostream</span>
                    stands for <span class="italic">input/output</span>.</p>
                <p>To use the functionality defined within the <span class="italic">iostream</span> library, we need to
                    include the <span class="italic">iostream</span> header
                    at the top of any code file that uses the content defined in <span class="italic">iostream</span>.
                </p>
                <h1>std::cout</h1>
                <p>The <span class="italic">iostream</span> library contains a few predefined variables for us to use.
                    One of the most useful is
                    <span class="bold">std::cout</span>, which allows us to send data to the console to be printed as
                    text. <span class="italic">cout</span> stands for
                    “character output”.
                </p>
                <p>In this program, we have included <span class="italic">iostream</span> so that we have access to
                    <span class="italic">std::cout</span>. Inside our <span class="italic">main</span>
                    function, we use <span class="italic">std::cout</span>, along with the <span class="bold">insertion
                        operator (<span class="code-text">&lt;&lt;</span>)</span>, to send the text <span
                        class="italic">Hello world!</span> to
                    the console to be printed.
                </p>
                <h1>Using <span class="code-text">std::endl</span> to output a newline</h1>
                <p>If we want to print separate lines of output to the console, we need to tell the console to move the
                    cursor to the next line. We can do that by outputting a newline. A <span class="bold">newline</span>
                    is an OS-specific
                    character or sequence of characters that moves the cursor to the start of the next line.</p>
                <p>One way to output a newline is to output <span class="code-text">std::endl</span> (which stands for
                    “end line”).</p>
                <h1>std::cin</h1>
                <p><span class="code-text">std::cin</span> is another predefined variable in the <span
                        class="code-text">iostream</span> library. Whereas <span class="code-text">std::cout</span>
                    prints data to the
                    console (using the insertion operator <span class="code-text">&lt;&lt;</span> to provide the data),
                    <span class="code-text">std::cin</span> (which stands for “character
                    input”) reads input from keyboard. We typically use the extraction operator <span
                        class="code-text">&gt;&gt;</span> to put the input
                    data in a variable (which can then be used in subsequent statements).

                Keywords and naming identifiers
            </header>
            <article>
                <h1>Keywords</h1>
                <p>C++ reserves a set of 92 words (as of C++23) for its own use. These words are called <span
                        class="bold">keywords</span> (or
                    reserved words), and each of these keywords has a special meaning within the C++ language.</p>
                <h1>Identifier naming rules</h1>
                <p>As a reminder, the name of a variable (or function, type, or other kind of item) is called an
                    identifier. C++ gives you a lot of flexibility to name identifiers as you wish. However, there are a
                    few rules that must be followed when naming identifiers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The identifier can not be a keyword. Keywords are reserved.</li>
                    <li>The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case), numbers, and the
                        underscore character. That means the name can not contain symbols (except the underscore) nor
                        whitespace (spaces or tabs).</li>
                    <li>The identifier must begin with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore. It can not start
                        with a number.</li>
                    <li>C++ is case sensitive, and thus distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. <span
                            class="code-text">nvalue</span> is different than <span class="code-text">nValue</span> is
                        different than <span class="code-text">NVALUE</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Identifier naming best practices</h1>
                <p>Now that you know how you can name a variable, let’s talk about how you should name a variable (or
                    function).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>It is conventional in C++ that variable names should begin with a lowercase letter. If the
                            variable name is a single word or acronym, the whole thing should be written in lowercase
                            letters.</p>
                        <p>Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for user-defined types
                            (such as structs, classes, and enumerations, all of which we will cover later).</p>
                        <p>If the variable or function name is multi-word, there are two common conventions: words
                            separated by underscores (sometimes called snake_case), or intercapped (sometimes called
                            camelCase, since the capital letters stick up like the humps on a camel).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid naming your identifiers starting with an underscore. Although syntactically legal, these
                        names are typically reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler use.</li>
                    <li>The name of your identifiers should make clear what the value they are holding means
                        (particularly if the units aren’t obvious). Identifiers should be named in a way that would help
                        someone who has no idea what your code does be able to figure it out as quickly as possible. In
                        3 months, when you look at your program again, you’ll have forgotten how it works, and you’ll
                        thank yourself for picking variable names that make sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid abbreviations, except when they are common and unambiguous (e.g. <span
                            class="code-text">num</span>, <span class="code-text">cm</span>, <span
                            class="code-text">idx</span>).</li>
                    <li>For variable declarations, it can be useful to use a comment to describe what a variable is
                        going to be used for, or to explain anything else that might not be obvious. For example, say
                        we’ve declared a variable that is supposed to store the number of characters in a piece of text.
                        Does the text “Hello World!” have 10, 11, 12 characters? It depends on whether we’re including
                        whitespace or punctuation. Rather than naming the variable
                        <span class="code-text">numCharsIncludingWhitespaceAndPunctuation</span>, which is rather
                        lengthy, a well placed comment on or
                        above the declaration line should help the user figure it out
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Whitespace and basic formatting
            </header>
            <article>
                <p><span class="bold">Whitespace</span> is a term that refers to characters that are used for formatting
                    purposes. In C++, this refers primarily to spaces, tabs, and newlines. Whitespace in C++ is
                    generally used for 3 things: separating certain language elements, inside text, and for formatting
                    code.</p>
                <h1>Some language elements must be whitespace-separated</h1>
                <p>The syntax of the language requires that some elements are separated by whitespace. This mostly
                    occurs when two keywords or identifiers must be placed consecutively, so the compiler can tell them
                    apart.</p>
                <h1>Quoted text takes the amount of whitespace literally</h1>
                <p>Inside quoted text, the amount of whitespace is taken literally.</p>
                <p>It should be also noted that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Newlines are not allowed in quoted text.</li>
                    <li>Quoted text separated by nothing but whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines) will be
                        concatenated.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Using whitespace to format code</h1>
                <p>Whitespace is otherwise generally ignored. This means we can use whitespace wherever we like to
                    format our code in order to make it easier to read.</p>
                <h1>Basic formatting</h1>
                <p>Unlike some other languages, C++ does not enforce any kind of formatting restrictions on the
                    programmer. For this reason, we say that C++ is a whitespace-independent language.</p>
                <p>Here are our recommendations for basic formatting:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It’s fine to use either tabs or spaces for indentation (most IDEs have a setting where you can
                        convert a tab press into the appropriate number of spaces). Developers who prefer spaces tend to
                        do so because it ensures that code is precisely aligned as intended regardless of which editor
                        or settings are used</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>There are two conventional styles for function braces.</p>
                        <p>Many developers prefer putting the opening curly brace on the same line as the statement:</p>
                        <div class="code-container">
                            <pre>
1 | int main() {
2 |     // statements here
3 | }</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>The justification for this is that it reduces the amount of vertical whitespace (as you
                            aren’t devoting an entire line to an opening curly brace), so you can fit more code on a
                            screen.</p>
                        <p>While some prefer putting braces on a new line:</p>
                        <div class="code-container">
                            <pre>
1 | int main()
2 | {
3 |     // statements here
4 | }</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>This enhances readability, and is less error prone since your brace pairs should always be
                            indented at the same level. If you get a compiler error due to a brace mismatch, it’s very
                            easy to see where.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Lines should not be too long. Typically, 80 characters has been the de facto standard for the
                        maximum length a line should be. If a line is going to be longer, it should be split (at a
                        reasonable spot) into multiple lines. This can be done by indenting each subsequent line with an
                        extra tab, or if the lines are similar, by aligning it with the line above (whichever is easier
                        to read).</li>
                    <li>If a long line is split with an operator (eg. << or +), the operator should be placed at the
                            beginning of the next line, not the end of the current line.</li>
                    <li>Use whitespace to make your code easier to read by aligning values or comments or adding spacing
                        between blocks of code.</li>
                </ol>

                Introduction to literals and operators
            </header>
            <article>
                <h1>Literals</h1>
                <p>Consider the following two statements:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <pre>
1 | std::cout << "Hello world!";
2 | int x {5};</pre>
                </div>
                <p>What are ‘”Hello world!”‘ and ‘5’? They are literals. A <span class="bold">literal</span> (also known
                    as a <span class="bold">literal constant</span>) is
                    a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.</p>
                <p>Literals and variables both have a value (and a type). Unlike a variable (whose value can be set and
                    changed through initialization and assignment respectively), the value of a literal is fixed and
                    cannot be changed. The literal <span class="code-text">5</span> always has value <span
                        class="code-text">5</span>. This is why literals are called constants.</p>
                <h1>Operators</h1>
                <p>In mathematics, an <span class="bold">operation</span> is a process involving zero or more input
                    values (called <sopan class="bold">operands</sopan>) that
                    produces a new value (called an output value). The specific operation to be performed is denoted by
                    a symbol called an <span class="bold">operator</span>.</p>
                <p>For example, as children we all learn that <span class="italic">2 + 3</span> equals <span
                        class="italic">5</span>. In this case, the literals <span class="italic">2</span> and <span
                        class="italic">3</span> are the
                    operands, and the symbol <span class="italic">+</span> is the operator that tells us to apply
                    mathematical addition on the
                    operands to produce the new value <span class="italic">5</span>.</p>
                <p>You are likely already quite familiar with standard arithmetic operators from common usage in
                    mathematics, including addition (<span class="code-text">+</span>), subtraction (<span
                        class="code-text">-)</span>, multiplication (<span class="code-text">*</span>), and division
                    (<span class="code-text">/</span>). In C++,
                    assignment (<span class="code-text">=</span>) is an operator as well, as are insertion (<span
                        class="code-text">&lt;&lt;</span>), extraction (<span class="code-text">&gt;&gt;</span>), and
                    equality (<span class="code-text">==</span>).
                    While most operators have symbols for names (e.g. <span class="code-text">+</span>, or <span
                        class="code-text">==</span>), there are also a number of
                    operators that are keywords (e.g. <span class="code-text">new</span>, <span
                        class="code-text">delete</span>, and <span class="code-text">throw</span>).</p>
                <p>The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator’s <span
                        class="bold">arity</span>.</p>
                <p>Operators in C++ come in four different arities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Unary</span> operators act on one operand.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Binary</span> operators act on two operands (often called <span
                            class="italic">left</span> and <span class="italic">right</span>, as the left operand
                        appears on the left side of the operator, and the right operand appears on the right side of the
                        operator).</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Ternary</span> operators act on three operands.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Nullary</span> operators act on zero operands.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Chaining operators</h1>
                <p>Operators can be chained together such that the output of one operator can be used as the input for
                    another operator.</p>
                <p>It’s enough to know that the arithmetic operators execute in the same order as they do in standard
                    mathematics: Parenthesis first, then Exponents, then Multiplication & Division, then Addition &
                    Subtraction. This ordering is sometimes abbreviated <span class="italic">PEMDAS</span>.</p>

                <h1>Expressions</h1>
                <p>In general programming, an <span class="bold">expression</span> is a non-empty sequence of literals,
                    variables, operators, and
                    function calls that calculates a value. The process of executing an expression is called <span
                        class="bold">evaluation</span>,
                    and the resulting value produced is called the <span class="bold">result</span> of the expression
                    (also sometimes called the
                    <span class="bold">return value</span>).
                </p>
                <p>Expressions do not end in a semicolon, and cannot be compiled by themselves. Rather, expressions are
                    always evaluated as part of statements.</p>
                <h1>Expression statements</h1>
                <p>We mentioned above that expressions cannot be executed by themselves -- they must exist as part of a
                    statement. Fortunately, it’s trivial to convert any expression into an equivalent statement. An
                    <span class="bold">expression statement</span> is a statement that consists of an expression
                    followed by a semicolon. When the
                    expression statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated.
                </p>
                <h1>Useless expression statements</h1>
                <p>We can also make expression statements that compile but have no effect. For example, the expression
                    statement (<span class="code-text">2 * 3;</span>) is an expression statement whose expression
                    evaluates to the result value of <span class="italic">6</span>,
                    which is then discarded. While syntactically valid, such expression statements are useless. Some
                    compilers (such as gcc and Clang) will produce warnings if they can detect that an expression
                    statement is useless.</p>
                <h1>Subexpressions, full expressions, and compound expressions</h1>
                <p>A <span class="bold">subexpression</span> is an expression used as an operand.</p>
                <p>A <span class="bold">full expression</span> is an expression that is not a subexpression.</p>
                <p>A <span class="bold">compound expression</span> is an expression that contains two or more uses of
                    operators.</p>
