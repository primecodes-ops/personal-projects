# Evaluation Form

This evaluation form uses HTML as its skeleton and uses a responsive CSS design.

### Do Note:

This is a learning project – it means that this project is a proof of my learning of HTML and responsive CSS design.

In the future, this project may be improved as I learn my way through Wed Development such as integrating JavaScript for a more dynamic web interaction.
